# Insurance-Data-Sampling-Methods

## Overview

This project analyzes an insurance dataset using various sampling methods. It includes details about insurance holders such as age, sex, bmi, charges, etc. Different statistical sampling techniques are applied to draw representative samples, which are then analyzed and compared with the actual data. The project demonstrates the application of sampling methods to assess the reliability and validity of data in real-world insurance analytics.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to evaluate and compare different sampling techniques to analyze insurance data and provide insights into how different sampling methods affect the quality of data analysis.

## Data Set

● age: age of primary beneficiary

● sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

● bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9.

● children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents.

● smoker: Smoking

● region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

● charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

## Key Findings

● The insurance charge and age are positively related to each other. But it is not perfectly linear.

● The charge and BMI value have a slight positive relationship.

● The age ranges for both males and females are approximately equal.

● Both females and males have approximately the same median medical cost.

● The BMI value has a random variation with the age of the people.

● Smokers pay higher charges for insurance than non-smokers. The median of smokers is about 30,000 while it is less than 10,000 in non-smokers.

● The medical costs for both males and females are approximately equal. It shows that gender doesn’t influence the medical cost.
